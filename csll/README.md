   CIRCULAR LINKED LIST :
A circular list is a list that does not contain any pointer pointing to NULL. In a circular linked list, all the nodes are inter-connected in a cyclic manner. Both singly and doubly linked lists can be circular.

     Singly Circular Linked List :
There is only one pointer in a singly linked list that points to NULL, i.e. the pointer from the last node of the list. If we want to make the singly linked list circular, we need to make the ‘Next’ pointer of the last node point to the first node.
