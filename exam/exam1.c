/*
 * You know that C strings end with a '\0' character, without which string operations would be impossible
 *  because they would not know where to stop processing. But this is not the only way to store strings.
 *
 *  Dan proposes to store strings in character arrays as follows:
 *
 *  - The first character n is interpreted as an integer giving the number of characters that constitute the string
 *  The next n characters are the actual contents of the string
 *
 *  For example, to represent the string
 *  dan
 *  we'd use an array of four characters: 3, 'd', 'a', 'n'. (Remember that a character is just a small int.)
 *
 *  These are called Dan strings.
 *
 *  Write the following function that takes a character array representing a Dan string, and allocates and
 *  returns a proper null-terminated C string. s is NOT to be modified.
