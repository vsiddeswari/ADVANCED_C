<h1>DOUBLE LINKED LIST</h1>
The singly linked list had a single pointer pointing to the next node. But a doubly linked list contains two pointers. One pointer points to the next node and one pointer to the previous node. Thus, a doubly linked list is a two-way chain.

Every node in a doubly linked list has-

1.Data
2.Address of the next node
3.Address of the previous node

The purpose of a doubly linked list is to enable both-way traversal while still allowing non-contiguous memory storage. Just like a singly linked list, we need to have a starting pointer pointing to the first node. The last node in the list points to NULL.
