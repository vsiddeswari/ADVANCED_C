<h1>single linked list</h1>
A singly linked list is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail).

Each element in a linked list is called a node. A single node contains data and a pointer to the next node which helps in maintaining the structure of the list.

The first node is called the head; it points to the first node of the list and helps us access every other element in the list. The last node, also sometimes called the tail, points to NULL which helps us in determining when the list ends.
